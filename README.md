# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
Started as a chemist, got hooked on the theory side of things, the computational puzzles. Spent a good chunk of time wrestling with Fortran together with my dinosaur mates. Then I found myself dipping my toes into material science. Picked up some Python, with varying degrees of success. Eventually, landed on next-generation sequencing and genetics. It's a whole different world, but fascinating. Just trying to figure it all out, really.
